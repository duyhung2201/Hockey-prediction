## 1. Data Acquisition 
The data acquisition process is one of the most important and initial steps of any data science pipeline. The data acquisition process for this project is as follows:
- **Data Source:** The NHL API - [https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/](https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/)
- **Data Format:** JSON
- **Data Retrieval:** Using the requests library, I will send a GET request to the NHL API to retrieve the data. The API will return a JSON object containing the requested data. The data will then be parsed and stored in a Pandas DataFrame in step **3.**

### 1.1. Data Retrieval
The following code snippet demonstrates the data retrieval process. The function game_id_generator() generates a list of game IDs for a given season. The class `DataDownloader()` is responsible for retrieving the data for a given game season and stores it in a JSON file.

```python
def game_id_generator(year: int) -> [str]:
    year = str(year)
    total_games = (1230 if year == '2016' else 1271)
    ids = []
    # this is the regular season
    for j in range(1, total_games+1):
        ids.append(year+'02'+'{:04d}'.format(j))

    # this is the playoffs
    for i in range(1, 10):
        for j in range(1, 10):
            for k in range(1, 8):
                ids.append(year+'030'+str(i)+str(j)+str(k))
    return ids
```
### 1.2. Data Storage
The file `data_downloader.py` contains the class `DataDownloader()` which is responsible for retrieving the data for a given game season and stores it in a JSON file. The class contains the following key methods:

- **`__init__(self, path: str|None, rewrite: bool = False,threaded:bool=True, worker:int=10, logger_path: str|None = None, log_level: int|None = logging.INFO)`**: The constructor of the class. It takes path to the directory where the data will be stored, a boolean value indicating whether to rewrite the data if it already exists, a boolean value indicating whether to use multithreading, the number of threads to use, the path to the logger file, and the log level. The default values are set to `None`, `False`, `True`, `10`, `None`, and `logging.INFO` respectively.
- **`download(self, year: int) -> None`**: This method is responsible for downloading the data for a given year. It takes the year as an argument and returns `None`.

A major feature of the Downloader class is that it can be used to download the data in parallel. This is achieved by using the `threading` module.

## 2. Interactive Debugging Tool
![Alt text](/assets/interactive-tool.png)

The screenshot displays some information about a specific game and an event within it, all of which can be dynamically configured using four interactive widgets. Below is the implementation of the tool.

```python
files = getFiles(f'201602')
data = read_data(files[0])

# Initialize widgets
seasons = widgets.Dropdown(
    options=['2016', '2017', '2018', '2019', '2020'], description='Season:')
game_type = widgets.Dropdown(
    options=['Regular', 'Playoffs'], description='Game Type:')
game_id_slider = widgets.IntSlider(
    min=1, max=len(files), step=1, description='Game ID:')
event_slider = widgets.IntSlider(min=1, max=len(
    data['liveData']['plays']['allPlays']), step=1, description='Event:')


def update_game_id_slider(*args):
    global files
    global data
    files = getFiles(f'{seasons.value}{game_type_digits[game_type.value]}')
    game_id_slider.value = 1
    game_id_slider.max = len(files)

    update_event_slider()


def update_event_slider(*args):
    global data
    global files
    data = read_data(files[game_id_slider.value-1])

    event_count = len(data['liveData']['plays']['allPlays'])
    if(event_count):
        event_slider.max = event_count
        event_slider.value = 1
        event_slider.min = 1
    else:
        event_slider.value = 0
        event_slider.min = 0
        event_slider.max = event_count


def update_event_plot(season, game_type, game_id, event_index):
    events = data['liveData']['plays']['allPlays']
    if (not events):
        print('No event')
        return

    print("gameId: ", data['gamePk'])
    home = data['liveData']['linescore']['teams']['home']['team']['abbreviation']
    away = data['liveData']['linescore']['teams']['away']['team']['abbreviation']
    print(f'{home} vs. {away}')

    event_data = events[event_index-1]

    coordinates = event_data['coordinates']
    if (not coordinates):
        return print(json.dumps(event_data, indent=4))

    period = event_data['about']['period']
    t = [i for i in data['liveData']['linescore']
         ['periods'] if i['num'] == period]
    if (t):
        isHomeOnRight = 1 if t[0]['home']['rinkSide'] == 'right' else -1

    summary = f"Event: {event_data['result']['event']}\nPeriod: {event_data['about']['period']}\nTime: {event_data['about']['periodTime']}\nTeam: {event_data['team']['name']}"

    print(summary)
    plt.title(event_data['result']['description'], y=1.1)

    plt.imshow(rink_image_np, extent=[-100, 100, -42.5, 42.5])
    plt.ylim(-42.5, 42.5)
    plt.xlim(-100, 100)
    plt.xticks([-100.0, -75.0, -50.0, -25.0, 0.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0])
    plt.yticks([-42.5, -21.25, 0, 21.25, 42.5])
    plt.scatter(coordinates['x'], coordinates['y'])
    plt.text(isHomeOnRight*(-75), 47, away, ha='center',
             va='center', fontsize=12)
    plt.text(isHomeOnRight*(75), 47, home, ha='center',
             va='center', fontsize=12)
    plt.xlabel("Feet")
    plt.ylabel("Feet")

    plt.show()


seasons.observe(update_game_id_slider, 'value')
game_type.observe(update_game_id_slider, 'value')
game_id_slider.observe(update_event_slider, 'value')

# Create interactive plot
interactive_plot = interactive(
    update_event_plot, season=seasons, game_type=game_type, game_id=game_id_slider, event_index=event_slider)
output = interactive_plot.children[-1]
output.layout.height = '450px'

display(interactive_plot)

```


## 3. Tidy Data
### 3.1. A small snippet of your final dataframe
First 10 rows of tidied dataframe:

![Alt text](/assets/tidied-df.png)
### 3.2. Adding the actual strength information to both shots and goal
Assuming penalty events are provided with a start time \(X\), duration \(T\), and the penalized team \(A\), any events occurring within the time frame \(X + T\) will see team \(A\) with a reduced player count by at least one, compared to the last event before time \(X\). This principle also applies to the opposing team. We will maintain a record of the number of players on each team from the start of the game (typically 5-5) until its conclusion. Consequently, we can deduce the on-ice strength during shots and goals within the time frame \(X + T\) based on the team executing the event.
### 3.3. Additional features
Real-time performance analysis enables a detailed examination of both team and player behaviors during a game. I will incorporate three metrics for each team, calculated from the start of the game up to each event:
- **Goals per Shot:** Calculated as the number of goals divided by the number of shots, this metric gauges scoring efficiency.
- **Saves per Shot:** Determined by dividing the number of saves made by the number of shots faced, this metric assesses goaltender performance.
- **Faceoff Win Rate:** Calculated as the number of faceoffs won divided by the total number of faceoffs that have occurred, this metric provides insight into a team's control over puck possession.

## 4. Simple Visualizations
### Question 1. Comparing the shot types over all the teams.
```python
df['season'] = df.gameId.apply(lambda x: str(x)[0:4])
```
In order to visualise only the seasons we are interested in, we first filter out all other seasons. In this code, you are essentially creating a new column, 'season', in your DataFrame df. The values in this column are derived from the 'gameId' column by extracting the first four characters, assuming that these characters represent the season information. For example, if a 'gameId' is '2017020235', the corresponding 'season' value would be '2017'. This operation allows you to easily categorize and analyze your data based on seasons, providing a valuable additional dimension for your analysis. 

So having done that we just wanna know the distribution of shots and goals in season 2017 just to have a general overview of the graph. We plotted bar graph so that it explains count of all type of events in a more easy way to convey the distribution of shot types across teams in the specified season, enabling your audience to quickly grasp and understand the key insights from the data.
