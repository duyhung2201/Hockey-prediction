# Features in the NHL Dataset

In the dataset we're working with, each feature provides unique and insightful data regarding the events of NHL games. Here is a breakdown of each feature:

- `game_id`: The unique identifier for each game.
- `event`: Type of event being recorded, such as a 'SHOT' or 'GOAL'.
- `prev_event`: The event that immediately precedes the current event.
- `period`: The period of the game in which the event occurred (1, 2, 3 for regular time, additional for overtime).
- `date_time`: The real-world date and time at which the event happened.
- `period_time`: The time on the game clock when the event occurred.
- `game_seconds`: Total number of seconds elapsed in the game when the event occurred.
- `time_from_pre_event`: The time elapsed since the previous event.
- `prev_team`: The team that made the previous event.
- `team`: The team that is associated with the current event.
- `x_coordinate`: The x-coordinate on the rink where the event occurred.
- `y_coordinate`: The y-coordinate on the rink where the event occurred.
- `prev_x_coordinate`: The x-coordinate of the previous event.
- `prev_y_coordinate`: The y-coordinate of the previous event.
- `shooter_name`: The name of the player who took the shot.
- `goalie_name`: The name of the goalie involved in the event.
- `shot_type`: The type of shot taken (e.g., slap shot, wrist shot).
- `empty_net`: Indicates whether the goal was empty when the shot was taken.
- `strength`: The strength of the team during the event (e.g., even strength, power play).
- `power_play_elapsed_time`: This feature tracks the time elapsed during a team's power play. It resets to zero once the power play ends.
- `friendly_non_goalie_skater`: This feature counts the number of skaters, excluding goalies, for the team currently in control of the puck.
- `opposing_non_goalie_skater`: This feature tallies the number of skaters, excluding goalies, for the team without the puck.
- `attacking_side`: The side of the rink is being targeted in the event.
- `net_x`: The x-coordinate of the net being targeted.
- `net_distance`: The distance of the shooter from the net when the shot was taken.
- `distance_from_prev_distance`: The change in distance from the previous event to the current event.
- `shot_angle`: The angle of the shot relative to the net.
- `is_goal`: Indicates whether the shot resulted in a goal (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- `is_empty_net`: Indicates whether the net was empty when the goal was scored.
- `is_rebound`: Indicates whether the shot was a rebound.
- `change_in_shot_angle`: The change in the shot angle from the previous shot.
- `speed_of_change`: Defined as the distance from the previous event, divided by the time since the previous event.

Each of these features will help us to analyze the game with greater precision and insight.
