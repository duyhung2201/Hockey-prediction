### A histogram of shot counts binned by distance
![Alt text](../assets/milestone2/question2/shot-by-distance-hist.png)

Shots and goals are more frequent at lower net distance, which indicates that shots taken closer to the net have a higher success rate.

### A histogram of shot counts binned by angle
![Alt text](../assets/milestone2/question2/shot-by-angle-hist.png)

The distribution appears to be symmetric around the 0 degrees angle. There are prominent peaks near the center, which correspond to shots taken from directly in front of the net. The high number of shots and goals in this area suggests that straight-on shots are more common and successful.

### A 2D histogram where one axis is the distance and the other is the angle.
![Alt text](../assets/milestone2/question2/join-plot-hist.png)

There is a sparse distribution of shots at greater distances, indicating that shots are less frequently taken from far away. As the distance from the net increases, the spread of angles from which shots are taken appears to decrease. This suggests that long-distance shots are less likely to be taken from wide angle.

### A histogram of average goal rate vs distance bins
![Alt text](../assets/milestone2/question2/Goal_rate_vs_distance.png)

Now we have calculated the goal rate which is the efficiency of goal scoring attempts. As seen from the bar plot we can see that the efficiency is more at the distance [0-20] since it's near the goal post. The interesting thing is that the efficiency increases at higher distances. Even though there were less shots in higher distance, the efficiency of scoring a goal is much better than distances in the middle. 

### A histogram of average goal rate vs angle bins
![Alt text](../assets/milestone2/question2/Goal_rate_vs_angle.png)

The goal rate seems to follow a similar trend that of the shot counts. So the efficiency of the goal is almost directly proportional to the shots taken. SInce there are more shots between the angle -20 to 20 also the efficiency of the goal is also high at those angles especially angles between -10 to 10 is the highest since these are shots taken directly in front of the net. As discussed the straight-on shots lead to a higer goal rate. 


### A histogram of goals count binned by distance.
![Alt text](../assets/milestone2/question2/goals_hist.png)
A significant majority of goals are scored from a close distance. There are very few goals scored on an empty net. They are spread out over a range of distances, including some from very long range. The non-empty net goals are rarely scored from distances beyond 75 feet, underscoring the difficulty of scoring long-range goals with the presence of goalie.

Regarding to the domain knowledge: “it is incredibly rare to score a non-empty net goal on the opposing team from within your defensive zone”, a histogram of goals from teams'defensive zone is created as below.

![Alt text](../assets/milestone2/question2/goal_defensive_zone_hist.png)

The histogram reveals that scoring a non-empty-net goal on the opposing team from the team's defensive zone is indeed a rare event. The distribution suggests that these occurrences are relatively random and are not heavily influenced by the distance from the goal. Additionally, it's noted that some goal data may be recorded incorrectly, with one example is the first goal of game 2018020722 at 04:39, 1st period. The x/y coordinates has been recorded incorrectly to -85 and -22 respectively.

## 3. BaseLine Models

We created a training and validation split and used net_distance from out train dataset to predict binanry classification of is_goal in our dataset and calculated the accuracy. The accuracy we were getting was 0.90 which is a good one. But then after looking at the predictions we noticed that most of the values were 0. When we used y_pred.sum(), the result was 0. This lead to the conclusion that the data is imbalanced and the class 0 is overrepresented. In hockey, it's common knowledge that goals are rarely scored, hence class 0 represents the amount of goals that were missed. 

### Logistic Regression Trained on Distance.

[link](https://www.comet.com/duyhung2201/model-registry/logisitc_regression_-net_distance/1.23.0?tab=assets)

ROC Curve: The AUC metrics = 0.69 shows that the model is able to discriminate between the positive and negative instances moderately. 

Gaol Rate: This graph shows a decreasing trend which shows that at the percentile decreases the goal rate also decreases. Therefore at the highest predicted probability the goal rate is at it's max. 

Cummulative Proportion of goal: This graph shows that at highest percentile there isnt any cummulation of goals. SO as the percentile decreases the accumulation of goal increases. Therefore at the highest predicted probability, there arent any accumulation of goals and vise versa. 

Reliability Diagram: The line follows the "Perfectly Calibrated" untill 0.2 and deviates from it and jumps to 0.7. This might indicate that the model predicted probability is only reliable untill 0.2. 

### Logistic Regression Trained on shot_angle

[link](https://www.comet.com/duyhung2201/model-registry/logisitc_regression_-shot_angle/1.11.0?tab=assets)

ROC Curve: The  AUC metrics = 0.51 indicates that the model is very close in being random. That is it is predicting the labels in a random manner. It is very close to not being able to discriminate the positive and negative instenses. 

Goal Rate: Since the AUC = 0.51 the model is not able to assign hight goal rate to highest predicted probability. The goal rate is 5% at percentile 0 and also 5% at 100 percentile and almost remains close to constant of 5% at every percentile. 

Cummulative Proportion of goal: Since the model is not able to discriminate properly there is almost close to being a uniform increase and decrease in accumulation of goal and percentile. 

Reliability Diagram: Having only one dot on the "Perfectly Calibrated" tells us that there is only limited infirmation. So the angle feature alone is not enough to predict the probability of being a goal or not. 

### Logistic Regression Trained on net_distance and shot_angle.

[link](https://www.comet.com/duyhung2201/model-registry/logisitc_regression_-shot_angle-net_distance/1.11.0?tab=assets)

As seen from the net_distance the AUC score, goal rate , accumulation of goals and reliability diagram are all similar except the goal rate for this graph starts from 30%. This indicates that the model is not able to train well with the shot_angle feature properly. 

### Using Random Baseline.

[link](https://www.comet.com/duyhung2201/ift-6758-b03-project/78e1833e53fa4a989067cd580382dbef?experiment-tab=params)
[link](https://www.comet.com/duyhung2201/model-registry/random_classifier_/1.31.0?tab=assets)

The AUC score is 0.50 since the model does not have any discriminative power. We can also see that the goal rate is very stationary at the around 9.3 to 10 for all values of percentile. The Accumulation of goal has a very unifrom increase and decrease in accumulation of goal and percentile. Since the model is random it is not very well calibrated and has very less information to make predictions since it has only one point.
