### A histogram of shot counts binned by distance

Shots and goals are more frequent at lower net distance, which indicates that shots taken closer to the net have a higher success rate.

### A histogram of shot counts binned by angle

The distribution appears to be symmetric around the 0 degrees angle. There are prominent peaks near the center, which correspond to shots taken from directly in front of the net. The high number of shots and goals in this area suggests that straight-on shots are more common and successful.

### A 2D histogram where one axis is the distance and the other is the angle.

There is a sparse distribution of shots at greater distances, indicating that shots are less frequently taken from far away. As the distance from the net increases, the spread of angles from which shots are taken appears to decrease. This suggests that long-distance shots are less likely to be taken from wide angle.

### A histogram of average goal rate vs distance bins

Now we have calculated the goal rate which is the efficiency of goal scoring attempts. As seen from the bar plot we can see that the efficiency is more at the distance [0-20] since it's near the goal post. The interesting thing is that the efficiency increases at higher distances. Even though there were less shots in higher distance, the efficiency of scoring a goal is much better than distances in the middle.

The goal rate seems to follow a similar trend that of the shot counts. So the efficiency of the goal is almost directly proportional to the shots taken. SInce there are more shots between the angle -20 to 20 also the efficiency of the goal is also high at those angles especially angles between -10 to 10 is the highest since these are shots taken directly in front of the net. As discussed the straight-on shots lead to a higer goal rate. 


### A histogram of goals count binned by distance.
![Alt text](../assets/milestone2/question2/goals_hist.png)
A significant majority of goals are scored from a close distance. There are very few goals scored on an empty net. They are spread out over a range of distances, including some from very long range. The non-empty net goals are rarely scored from distances beyond 75 feet, underscoring the difficulty of scoring long-range goals with the presence of goalie.

Regarding to the domain knowledge: “it is incredibly rare to score a non-empty net goal on the opposing team from within your defensive zone”, a histogram of goals from teams'defensive zone is created as below.

The histogram reveals that scoring a non-empty-net goal on the opposing team from the team's defensive zone is indeed a rare event. The distribution suggests that these occurrences are relatively random and are not heavily influenced by the distance from the goal. Additionally, it's noted that some goal data may be recorded incorrectly, with one example is the first goal of game 2018020722 at 04:39, 1st period. The x/y coordinates has been recorded incorrectly to -85 and -22 respectively.

## 3. BaseLine Models

3.1 The accuracy we were getting was 0.90 which is a good one. But then after looking at the predictions we noticed that most of the values were 0. When we used y_pred.sum(), the result was 0. This lead to the conclusion that the data is imbalanced and the class 0 is overrepresented. In hockey, it's common knowledge that goals are rarely scored, hence class 0 represents the amount of goals that were missed. 

## 4. Feature engineering II

In the dataset we're working with, each feature provides unique and insightful data regarding the events of NHL games. Here is a breakdown of each feature:

- `game_id`: The unique identifier for each game.
- `event`: Type of event being recorded, such as a 'SHOT' or 'GOAL'.
- `prev_event`: The event that immediately precedes the current event.
- `period`: The period of the game in which the event occurred (1, 2, 3 for regular time, additional for overtime).
- `date_time`: The real-world date and time at which the event happened.
- `period_time`: The time on the game clock when the event occurred.
- `game_seconds`: Total number of seconds elapsed in the game when the event occurred.
- `time_from_pre_event`: The time elapsed since the previous event.
- `prev_team`: The team that made the previous event.
- `team`: The team that is associated with the current event.
- `x_coordinate`: The x-coordinate on the rink where the event occurred.
- `y_coordinate`: The y-coordinate on the rink where the event occurred.
- `prev_x_coordinate`: The x-coordinate of the previous event.
- `prev_y_coordinate`: The y-coordinate of the previous event.
- `shooter_name`: The name of the player who took the shot.
- `goalie_name`: The name of the goalie involved in the event.
- `shot_type`: The type of shot taken (e.g., slap shot, wrist shot).
- `empty_net`: Indicates whether the goal was empty when the shot was taken.
- `strength`: The strength of the team during the event (e.g., even strength, power play).
- `power_play_elapsed_time`: This feature tracks the time elapsed during a team's power play. It resets to zero once the power play ends.
- `friendly_non_goalie_skater`: This feature counts the number of skaters, excluding goalies, for the team currently in control of the puck.
- `opposing_non_goalie_skater`: This feature tallies the number of skaters, excluding goalies, for the team without the puck.
- `attacking_side`: The side of the rink is being targeted in the event.
- `net_x`: The x-coordinate of the net being targeted.
- `net_distance`: The distance of the shooter from the net when the shot was taken.
- `distance_from_prev_distance`: The change in distance from the previous event to the current event.
- `shot_angle`: The angle of the shot relative to the net.
- `is_goal`: Indicates whether the shot resulted in a goal (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- `is_empty_net`: Indicates whether the net was empty when the goal was scored.
- `is_rebound`: Indicates whether the shot was a rebound.
- `change_in_shot_angle`: The change in the shot angle from the previous shot.
- `speed_of_change`: Defined as the distance from the previous event, divided by the time since the previous event.

Each of these features will help us to analyze the game with greater precision and insight.
