The screenshot displays some information about a specific game and an event within it, all of which can be dynamically configured using four interactive widgets. Below is the implementation of the tool.

```python
files = getFiles(f'201602')
data = read_data(files[0])

# Initialize widgets
seasons = widgets.Dropdown(
    options=['2016', '2017', '2018', '2019', '2020'], description='Season:')
game_type = widgets.Dropdown(
    options=['Regular', 'Playoffs'], description='Game Type:')
game_id_slider = widgets.IntSlider(
    min=1, max=len(files), step=1, description='Game ID:')
event_slider = widgets.IntSlider(min=1, max=len(
    data['liveData']['plays']['allPlays']), step=1, description='Event:')


def update_game_id_slider(*args):
    global files
    global data
    files = getFiles(f'{seasons.value}{game_type_digits[game_type.value]}')
    game_id_slider.value = 1
    game_id_slider.max = len(files)

    update_event_slider()


def update_event_slider(*args):
    global data
    global files
    data = read_data(files[game_id_slider.value-1])

    event_count = len(data['liveData']['plays']['allPlays'])
    if(event_count):
        event_slider.max = event_count
        event_slider.value = 1
        event_slider.min = 1
    else:
        event_slider.value = 0
        event_slider.min = 0
        event_slider.max = event_count


def update_event_plot(season, game_type, game_id, event_index):
    events = data['liveData']['plays']['allPlays']
    if (not events):
        print('No event')
        return

    print("gameId: ", data['gamePk'])
    home = data['liveData']['linescore']['teams']['home']['team']['abbreviation']
    away = data['liveData']['linescore']['teams']['away']['team']['abbreviation']
    print(f'{home} vs. {away}')

    event_data = events[event_index-1]

    coordinates = event_data['coordinates']
    if (not coordinates):
        return print(json.dumps(event_data, indent=4))

    period = event_data['about']['period']
    t = [i for i in data['liveData']['linescore']
         ['periods'] if i['num'] == period]
    if (t):
        isHomeOnRight = 1 if t[0]['home']['rinkSide'] == 'right' else -1

    summary = f"Event: {event_data['result']['event']}\nPeriod: {event_data['about']['period']}\nTime: {event_data['about']['periodTime']}\nTeam: {event_data['team']['name']}"

    print(summary)
    plt.title(event_data['result']['description'], y=1.1)

    plt.imshow(rink_image_np, extent=[-100, 100, -42.5, 42.5])
    plt.ylim(-42.5, 42.5)
    plt.xlim(-100, 100)
    plt.xticks([-100.0, -75.0, -50.0, -25.0, 0.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0])
    plt.yticks([-42.5, -21.25, 0, 21.25, 42.5])
    plt.scatter(coordinates['x'], coordinates['y'])
    plt.text(isHomeOnRight*(-75), 47, away, ha='center',
             va='center', fontsize=12)
    plt.text(isHomeOnRight*(75), 47, home, ha='center',
             va='center', fontsize=12)
    plt.xlabel("Feet")
    plt.ylabel("Feet")

    plt.show()


seasons.observe(update_game_id_slider, 'value')
game_type.observe(update_game_id_slider, 'value')
game_id_slider.observe(update_event_slider, 'value')

# Create interactive plot
interactive_plot = interactive(
    update_event_plot, season=seasons, game_type=game_type, game_id=game_id_slider, event_index=event_slider)
output = interactive_plot.children[-1]
output.layout.height = '450px'

display(interactive_plot)

```


## 3. Tidy Data
### 3.1. A small snippet of your final dataframe
First 10 rows of tidied dataframe:

### 3.2. Adding the actual strength information to both shots and goal
Assuming penalty events are provided with a start time \(X\), duration \(T\), and the penalized team \(A\), any events occurring within the time frame \(X + T\) will see team \(A\) with a reduced player count by at least one, compared to the last event before time \(X\). This principle also applies to the opposing team. We will maintain a record of the number of players on each team from the start of the game (typically 5-5) until its conclusion. Consequently, we can deduce the on-ice strength during shots and goals within the time frame \(X + T\) based on the team executing the event.
### 3.3. Additional features
Real-time performance analysis enables a detailed examination of both team and player behaviors during a game. I will incorporate three metrics for each team, calculated from the start of the game up to each event:
- **Goals per Shot:** Calculated as the number of goals divided by the number of shots, this metric gauges scoring efficiency.
- **Saves per Shot:** Determined by dividing the number of saves made by the number of shots faced, this metric assesses goaltender performance.
- **Faceoff Win Rate:** Calculated as the number of faceoffs won divided by the total number of faceoffs that have occurred, this metric provides insight into a team's control over puck possession.
